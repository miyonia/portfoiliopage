<h1>
    About me
  </h1>
 <P>
 My name is MiYonia Nicholson I'm a 17 year old girl. I like to ride a bike and hang out with friends and family. We like doing things like going to the movies and play at the  park. I am a very kind person i also like helping other people. I would help a person with anything like if they need a shoulder to cry on or if they need to get away from home I would be there. I help people younger than me, the same age as me, or even older than me.
The reason why I like helping other people and being there for other people is because nobody was never here for me, I never had a shoulder to cry on and I know how it feels to feel empty on the inside and feel hopeless and useless like don't nobody want you around and that's not a good feeling. I know how it feels to not want to be alive anymore and im helping other people so they could know they have many reasons they probably don't see. Unlike me, I feel like I'm living for other people and not myself because i never had nobody here to tell me the reasons I had to live i never had a shoulder to cry on. People only notice when i'm doing bad they never when im doing good.
